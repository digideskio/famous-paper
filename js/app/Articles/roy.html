<h1>I Could Watch Roy Hibbert Blocking This Little Kid's Shot All Day Long</h1>
<p>Indiana Pacers big man Roy Hibbert visited Paramount School of Excellence in Indianapolis and relived his childhood when he wasn't yet an NBA star for a cute video. The best part is when he swats the crap out of a kid's weak layup, which has been GIFed below. (Second-best part is Hibbert using a child as a human shield in dodgeball.)</p>

<p>The GIF's really missing the crushing thump of Hibbert's hand on the rejection, so watch the video for the full experience.</p>
